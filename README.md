FNCE30010 Algorithmic Trading

This was easily my favourite subject at univeristy yet.

I built two market simulation bots to trade the market based on internal valuations, market arbitrage as well as multi-market trading.
The goal was to increase my utility given a protfolio utility function given some risk preference.

I learnt mostly <b> asynchronous programming and the giant headache it is, object oriented python and how delicate it is in a dynamically typed langauge, how 
market makers perform valuations and price securities, as well as arbitrage theory. </b>

Unfortunately the code was all run on a simulation platform provided to us temporarily, but the concepts are applicable widely.
